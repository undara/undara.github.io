Hello! 

I am a research scientist at [AI Lab, CyberAgent, Inc](https://cyberagent.ai/ailab/research/). My research interests lie at the intersection of econometrics, machine learning and economics. 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Golub Capital Social Impact Lab](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/centers-initiatives/sil) led by [Susan Athey](https://athey.people.stanford.edu) at the [Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu). I received a PhD in Economics from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/econ/), where my main advisor was [Hiroaki Kaido](http://people.bu.edu/hkaido/). My other advisors were [Iván Fernández-Val](https://sites.bu.edu/ivanf/), [Ching-to Albert Ma](https://people.bu.edu/ma/) and [Jean-Jacques Forneron](http://jjforneron.com).
